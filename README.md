## Title
Week 1 JavaScript Code Challenges

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to the Week 1 JavaScript coding challenges. Each challenge is organized into its own folder with a dedicated `.js` file containing the solution code. The challenges test basic programming skills such as input handling, arithmetic calculations, and conditional logic using JavaScript.


### Challenges Included:

#### 1. **Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator **

This challenge involves creating a simple calculator to determine the basic ingredients needed to make a specific number of cups of Kenyan chai.

***The Standard Recipe for 1 Cup of Chai:

-Water: 200 ml
-Milk: 50 ml
-Tea Leaves (Majani): 1 tablespoon
-Sugar (Sukari): 2 teaspoons (optional, but included for this challenge)


#### 2. **Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator **

This challenge is to create a simple program to estimate the fare for a boda boda ride.

***Fare Calculation Rules:

-Base Fare: KES 50 (applied to every ride).
-Per Kilometer Charge: KES 15 for every kilometer traveled.


#### 3. **Simplified Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator **

This challenge is to create a simplified estimator for transaction fees.

***Simplified Fee Structure:

-The basic transaction fee is 1.5% of the transaction amount.
-However, there's a minimum fee of KES 10. If 1.5% of the amount is less than KES 10, the fee charged is KES 10.
-There's also a maximum fee of KES 70. If 1.5% of the amount is more than KES 70, the fee charged is KES 70.
